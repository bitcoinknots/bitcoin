# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of Bitcoin Knots is typically supported.
If you need longer support periods, consider using Bitcoin Core instead, or
if you are willing to financially fund long-term maintenance, you may contact
Luke Dashjr at luke_bcknots_funding@dashjr.org.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to luke_bcknots_security@dashjr.org (not for support).
